def shortest_temporal_path(tnet, steps_per_t='all', i=None, j=None, it=None, minimise='temporal_distance'):
    """
    Shortest temporal path

    Parameters
    --------------

    tnet : tnet obj, array or dict
        input network. nettype: bu, bd.

    steps_per_t : int or str
        If str, should be 'all'.
        How many edges can be travelled during a single time-point.

    i : list
        List of node indicies to restrict analysis. These are nodes the paths start from. Default is all nodes.

    j : list
        List of node indicies to restrict analysis. There are nodes the paths end on.  Default is all nodes.

    it : None, int, list
        Time points for parts. 
        Either None (default) which takes all time points,
        an integer to indicate which time point to start at,
        or a list of time-points that is included in analysis
        (including end time-point).  

    minimise : str
        Can be "temporal_distance", returns the path that has the smallest temporal distance.
        It is possible there can be a path that is a smaller
        topological distance (this option currently not available).

    Returns
    -------------------
    paths : pandas df
        Dataframe consisting of information about all the paths found.

    Notes
    ---------------

    The shortest temporal path calculates the temporal and topological distance there to be a path between nodes.

    The argument steps_per_t allows for multiple nodes to be travelled per time-point.

    Topological distance is the number of edges that are travelled. Temporal distance is the number of time-points.

    This function returns the path that is the shortest temporal distance away.

    Examples
    --------

    Let us start by creating a small network.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> import teneto
    >>> G = np.zeros([4, 4, 3])
    >>> G[0, 1, [0, 2]] = 1
    >>> G[0, 3, [2]] = 1
    >>> G[1, 2, [1]] = 1
    >>> G[2, 3, [1]] = 1

    Let us look at this network to see what is there.

    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)
    >>> ax = teneto.plot.slice_plot(G, ax, nodelabels=[0,1,2,3], timelabels=[0,1,2], cmap='Set2')
    >>> plt.tight_layout()
    >>> fig.show()

    .. plot::

        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import teneto
        G = np.zeros([4, 4, 3])
        G[0, 1, [0, 2]] = 1
        G[0, 3, [2]] = 1
        G[1, 2, [1]] = 1
        G[2, 3, [1]] = 1
        fig,ax = plt.subplots(1)
        teneto.plot.slice_plot(G,ax,nodelabels=[0,1,2,3],timelabels=[0,1,2],cmap='Set2')
        plt.tight_layout()
        fig.show()

    Here we can visualize what the shortest paths are.
    Let us start by starting at
    node 0 we want to find the path to node 3, starting at time 0. To do this we write:

    >>> sp = teneto.networkmeasures.shortest_temporal_path(G, i=0, j=3, it=0)
    >>> sp['temporal-distance']
    0    2
    Name: temporal-distance, dtype: int64
    >>> sp['topological-distance']
    0    3
    Name: topological-distance, dtype: int64
    >>> sp['path includes']
    0    [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]]
    Name: path includes, dtype: object

    Here we see that the shortest path takes 3 steps (topological distance of 3) at 2 time points.

    It starts by going from node 0 to 1 at t=0, then 1 to 2 and 2 to 3 at t=1.
    We can see all the nodes
    that were travelled in the "path includes" list.

    In the above example, it was possible to traverse multiple edges at a single time-point.
    It is possible to restrain that by setting the steps_per_t argument

    >>> sp = teneto.networkmeasures.shortest_temporal_path(G, i=0, j=3, it=0, steps_per_t=1)
    >>> sp['temporal-distance']
    0    3
    Name: temporal-distance, dtype: int64
    >>> sp['topological-distance']
    0    1
    Name: topological-distance, dtype: int64
    >>> sp['path includes']
    0    [[0, 3]]
    Name: path includes, dtype: object

    Here we see that the path is now only one edge, 0 to 3 at t=2.
    The quicker path is no longer possible.
