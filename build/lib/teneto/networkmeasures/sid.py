def sid(tnet, communities, axis=0, calc='overtime', decay=0):
    r"""
    Segregation integration difference (SID). An estimation of each community or global difference of within versus between community strength.[sid-1]_

    Parameters
    ----------

    tnet: array, dict
        Temporal network input (graphlet or contact). Allowerd nettype: 'bu', 'bd', 'wu', 'wd'

    communities : array
        a Nx1 vector or NxT array of community assignment.

    axis : int
        Dimension that is returned 0 or 1 (default 0).
        Note, only relevant for directed networks.
        i.e. if 0, node i has Aijt summed over j and t.
        and if 1, node j has Aijt summed over i and t.

    calc : str
        'overtime' returns SID over time (a 1 x community vector) (default);

        'community_pairs' returns a community x community x time matrix, which is the SID for each community pairing;

        'community_avg' (returns a community x time matrix). Which is the normalized average of each community to all other communities.

    decay: int
        if calc = 'community_pairs' or 'community_avg', then decay is possible where the centrality of
        the previous time point is carried over to the next time point but decays
        at a value of $e^decay$ such that the temporal centrality measure becomes: $D(t+1) = e^{-decay}D(t) + D(t+1)$.

    Returns
    -------

    sid: array
        segregation-integration difference. Format: 2d or 3d numpy array (depending on calc) representing (community,community,time) or (community,time)

    Notes
    ------
    SID tries to quantify if there is more segergation or intgration compared to other time-points.
    If SID > 0, then there is more segregation than usual. If SID < 0, then there is more integration than usual.

    There are three different variants of SID, one is a global measure (calc='overtime'), the second is a value per community (calc='community_avg'),
    the third is a value for each community-community pairing (calc='community_pairs').

    First we calculate the temporal strength for each edge. This is calculate by

    .. math:: S_{i,t} = \sum_j G_{i,j,t}

    The pairwise SID, when the network is undirected, is calculated by

    .. math:: SID_{A,B,t} = ({2 \over {N_A (N_A - 1)}}) S_{A,t} - ({{1} \over {N_A * N_B}}) S_{A,B,t})

    Where :math:`S_{A,t}` is the average temporal strength at time-point t for community A. :math:`N_A` is the number of nodes in community A.

    When calculating the SID for a community, it is calculated byL

    .. math:: SID_{A,t} = \sum_b^C({2 \over {N_A (N_A - 1)}}) S_{A,t} - ({{1} \over {N_A * N_b}}) S_{A,b,t})

    Where C is the number of communities.

    When calculating the SID globally, it is calculated byL

    .. math:: SID_{t} = \sum_a^C\sum_b^C({2 \over {N_a (N_a - 1)}}) S_{A,t} - ({{1} \over {N_a * N_b}}) S_{a,b,t})
