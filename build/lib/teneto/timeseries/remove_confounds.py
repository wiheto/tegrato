def remove_confounds(timeseries, confounds, confound_selection=None, clean_params=None):
    """
    Removes specified confounds using nilearn.signal.clean

    Parameters
    ----------
    timeseries : array or dataframe
        input timeseries with dimensions: (node,time)
    confounds : array or dataframe
        List of confounds. Expected format is (confound, time).
        If using TenetoBIDS, this does not need to be specified.
    confound_selection : list
        List of confounds. If None, all confoudns are removed
    clean_params : dict
        Dictionary of kawgs to pass to nilearn.signal.clean

    Returns
    -------
    Says all TenetBIDS.get_selected_files with confounds removed with _rmconfounds at the end.

    Note
    ----
    There may be some issues regarding loading non-cleaned data through the TenetoBIDS functions instead of the cleaned data. This depeneds on when you clean the data.
